# Machine Learning / Hugging Face caches
# Hugging Face models are downloaded to a global cache by default, usually ~/.cache/huggingface/
# If you configure HF_HOME or HF_DATASETS_CACHE to be inside the project,
# you'd need to ignore those specific directories.
# For example, if you explicitly cache models in a local directory:
# .hf_cache/
# .cache/ # General cache directory

# PyTorch checkpoints/saved models (if you save them locally)

*.pth
